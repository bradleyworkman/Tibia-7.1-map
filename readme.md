This is an upload of the Tibia 7.1 map produced by [Under Influence@otland.net](https://otland.net/members/under-influence.54602/); commits reflect changes made in [this thread](https://otland.net/threads/7-1-real-tibia-map-as-close-as-possible.270484/).

Thanks to 222222 Tibia 7.4 Release, I was able to achieve a dream of mine to reduce tibia map to 7.1 (this is 7.4 otbm format still)! I think I covered at least 95% of changed places between 7.1 and 7.4, removed quest/level doors, mailboxes, rookgaard premium, ladders instead of stairs, old quest rooms...

Something that could be inaccurate are some tree placements and the sand south of Darashia.

Used my memory, old screenshots and tibia world map of 7.1 as a guide. have fun! If you find out that I missed something and other inaccuracies, help me and the community build the best 7.1 map.
